description: Accomplished author, poet, essayist, and memoirist Eleanor Hallowell
  Abbott dabbled in many different genres over the course of her career. Rainy Week
  is a hilarious, irreverent account of a New England house party that goes horribly
  awry. Packed with memorable characters and a series of unforgettably raucous scenes
  and set pieces, it's a diverting tale if you're looking for some fun, light reading
  material.
